## About Acuity Scheduling on Mac

**Acuity Scheduling** is a complete online scheduling solution used to publish availability, accept self-service bookings, and automate confirmations and reminders. In a desktop wrapper, Acuity feels like a native app while keeping all the power of your account. *(Features such as calendar syncing, automated email/SMS reminders, and payment processor integrations are provided by Acuity itself.)*

Acuity supports **calendar syncing and staff/calendar management** so your availability stays accurate across locations and services. Running it as a desktop app means faster switching with `‚åò + Tab`, fewer browser tabs, and a focused workspace tailored to your role.

Collect **payments and deposits** at booking through supported processors (e.g., **Stripe, Square, PayPal**) and streamline checkout and no-show protection with stored cards and deposits ‚Äî all accessible in the same focused window on macOS.

The desktop wrapper approach is ideal for operators who live in Acuity all day (salons & spas, coaching, fitness, wellness, professional services). You get the same **client self-scheduling, branded booking pages, reminders, and forms** ‚Äî just with a native-feeling macOS presence.
